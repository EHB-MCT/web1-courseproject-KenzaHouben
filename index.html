					<p>
						My name is Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who lives in his hobbit-hole in
						the lands of Bag End. You might wonder what my profession is? Well,
						my profession is being a professional burglar. But before I delve
						more into my skills and experiences of being a burglar let me talk a
						little more about myself.

				<h2>Let's start about the positive things that I like, shall we?</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="item">
				<div>
					<img src="images/hobbit-house-1.jpg" class="hobbit-house-pic" />
				</div>
				<h3>My hobbit-hole</h3>
				<p>
					My house is one of the most important things in my life. You might
					wonder why, but for a hobbit their home is their comfort which is an
					important thing
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="item">
				<div>
					<img src="images/old-bilbo.jpg" class="pipe-pic" />
				</div>
				<h3>My pipe</h3>
				<p>
					When I am not breaking into dragon's lairs, I like to smoke my pipe.
					And I like to do that while watching nature and writing my book.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="item">
				<img src="images/bilbo-frodo.jpg" class="bilbo-frodo-pic" />
				<h3>My nephew, Frodo</h3>
				<p>
					Frodo who I consider my nephew (while he actually is my cousin) is
					someone who brings me joy every morning. He keeps me company and fills
					my days with laughter. I am very proud to be called his uncle.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="item">
				<img src="images/bilbo-balin.jpg" class="bilbo-balin-pic" />
				<h3>My friends</h3>
				<p>
					My friends Dwalin, Balin, Fili, Kili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin,
					Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin the dwarves and Gandalf are the
					people that helped my find my courage and are the people I care a lot
					about.
				</p>

			<div class="informatie-Bilbo">
				<h2>Let's now move on to my dislikes.</h2>

			<div class="item2">
				<img
					src="images/dwarves-eating-bilbo's-food.jpg"
					class="bilbo-food-pic"
				/>
				<h3>People disrupting my comfort</h3>
				<p>
					The thing I dislike most would be anything that disrupts my normally
					relaxed rural idyll everyday life. When I talk about this I recall the
					day where I met my dwarves friend. They came into my home and started
					moving things around and ate my food right in front of my face! Can
					you believe this?! You don't just come into a hobbit's home and
					disrupt their comfort! However, I have forgiven them. So all ends
					well.
