					Through my adventures in Middle-Earth if have gained a lot of
					experience as a hobbit and burglar. And I now know how the world truly
					works. Back in Bag End I was like a naive child believing that staying
					in my hobbit-hole would protect me. I was wrong. Unfortunately, not
					everyone has good intentions. For example the orcs when waging a war
					killed hundreds of people. Why? I don't know and it doesn't matter.
					The same went with Smaug the dragon destroyed countless people only
					for treasure. And unfortunately sometimes good people like my friend,
					Thorin, can lose their way along the road.

				Thanks to my experience from my adventuring. I know now how to handle
				life-threatening situations. I also know how to defend myself and most
				importantly: I always try to go for the peaceful route. Like Gandalf
				said: "True courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when
				to spare one."
