					Through my adventures in Middle-Earth if have gained a lot of
					experience. And I now know how the world truly works. Back in Bag End
					I was like a naive child believing that staying in my hobbit-hole
					would protect me. I was wrong. Unfortunately, not everyone has good
					intentions. For example the orcs when waging a war killed hundreds of
					people. Why? I don't know and it doesn't matter. The same went with
					Smaug the dragon destroyed countless people only for treasure. And
					unfortunately sometimes good people like my friend, Thorin, can lose
					their way along the road.

			<p>
				Thanks to my experience from my adventuring. I know now how to handle
				life-threatening situations. I also know how to defend myself and most
				importantly: I always try to go for the peaceful route. Like Gandalf
				said: "True courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when
				to spare one."
