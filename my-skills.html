				<h2>My friend, Gandalf</h2>
				<p>
					When Gandalf offered me a job as a professional burglar, I was quite
					puzzled. I mean who offers someone a job as a burglar? But then
					Gandalf explained to me why I was perfect for the job.

				<h2>My contract</h2>
				<p>
					Gandalf offered me the contract of the agreements that came with the
					job. I was offered to steal the Arkenstone back from Smaug. And a
					hobbit was the perfect job for this. Thanks to our big feet we can
					move around as quiet as a mouse. And our smell wasn't known to the
					dragon which made me the perfect person for the job.

				<h2>My first weapon, the sword</h2>
				<p>
					Not only am I good sneaking around, I am also well-versed with the
					sword. Through my adventures I have learned myself how to handle with
					the sword to prepare myself for dangerous situations.

				<h2>My encounters with danger</h2>
				<p>
					And last but not least. I am a master for getting myself away for
					dangerous situations and stalling for time. One time I had to find a
					way when confronting Gollum who wanted to eat me. Who did I do this?
					By answering riddles. That way I tricked him by stalling enough for
					time to find an opportunity to slip away.
